# Store Management System

## Overview

The **Store Management System** is a software solution designed to streamline daily store operations. It allows different roles to manage the store's inventory and user data. The system is designed to be used by three main types of users: **Cashiers**, **Managers**, and **Administrators**.

### Roles and Permissions:
1. **Cashier**:  
   - Can create new items in the store's inventory.
   
2. **Manager**:  
   - Can restock items in the store.
   
3. **Administrator**:  
   - Can modify and manage user data, including creating and deleting users, as well as assigning roles.

## Features

### Cashier Features:
- Add new items to the store's inventory.
- Manage product details such as name, price, and quantity.

### Manager Features:
- Restock existing items in the store.
- View current inventory levels.
- Update product quantities.

### Administrator Features:
- Modify user data (create, edit, delete users).
- Assign and update user roles (Cashier, Manager, Administrator).
- Monitor and audit system usage.

# Attention
Despite all the work we put in the program, we were unfortunately unable to complete the project with all the requirements implemented in the project. Some features such as the log in and admin roles we could not implement without radically changing the architecture of the project at a very late stage of the project
